An ERC20 token contract with a staking mechanism that provides rewards based on staking duration. The contract allows user to mint new token, stake their tokens and
unstake them. Users receive rewards for staking, with rewards increasing based on the length of time staked. It handles the calculation and distribution of rewards.
Hence, this is a fully functional DeFi-like contract where users can mint, stake, and unstake tokens, and receive rewards proportional to their staking duration.
